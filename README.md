# Pixie Cat 🐱✨

**Pixie Cat** is a tiny pixelated cat living on your screen.  
The cat has a soul and lives with you all the time — through your good and bad memories.  
With Pixie Cat, you’re never truly alone.

## Why This Exists

Pixie Cat started as a project for fun — a reminder that:

> Code isn’t just for solving problems.  
> It’s also for exploring ideas, expressing creativity, and building something just because it sparks joy.

It made me realize: **you can create a soul with coding**.  
And maybe, just maybe, it can make someone’s day a little better.

## About This Project

The pixel art cat assets are from the amazing free sprite pack:

Pixie Cat runs on **Windows** and **Linux** (both Wayland and X11) — so whether you’re on your desktop or your laptop, your tiny companion is always with you.

- **Attack** — Happens when the cursor is close to the cat.
